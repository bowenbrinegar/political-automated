# Political Wars

(https://bowenbrinegar.github.io/political-automated/) \
This project was a combination of both of the assigned homeworks, whose goals were \
to get students to Manipulate DOM elements and get more familiar with Javascript \
through a "game format"

This is the second version of this project. The original was a two player game that \
was played locally. 

# Challenges

### How do you make a game app?
A lot of what went into building the functionality of this game is thanks to Math.Random. \
One of the ways I complicated that was by having many Characters, with 4 unique tools in \
which they could battle. Each time the tools changes value, but there were different ranges \
for each tools, so as you progress throughout the game there's a path of tools that you want to \
end up using. It can be different each time too, so as a player you constantly have to be looking \
at the News Feed.

### How do you make an automated response to player actions
It's actaully a simpler solution than the header sounds, seeing the decision tree of this app does \
not accomplish a large scope of data. It starts with a simple function that returns random functions \
and with some conditionals the app defaults to the health regenrateive tool when the computers score \
goes below a certain number.

### How do you create a News Feed
DOM manipulation and a set of 3 divs to manually do overflow: scroll

### How do you build an app using Bootstrap
Working with Grids and Bootstrap Components was a new addition to my coding stratosfear, but a welcome \
one! It allows you to rapidly develop UI, so you can focus on the core of the application works.
